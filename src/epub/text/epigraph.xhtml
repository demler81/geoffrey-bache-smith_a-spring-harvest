					<span>If there be one among the Muses nine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Loves not so much <em>Completion</em> as <em>the Will</em>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And less the austere saint than the fond sinner:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Loves scanty ruins, garlanded with years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Better than lofty palaces entire:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To her I dedicate this spoil√®d sheaf</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of rime that scarcely came to harvesting.</span>

				<p>
					<span>There is a window here in Magdalen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Composite, methinks, of fragments that stark Mars</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has scattered. Even so my verses be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Composite of memories and half-uttered dreams</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Welded together sans due ordinance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which might have been far other, but that Mars</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Scattered and harried them with his ruthless flail.</span>
